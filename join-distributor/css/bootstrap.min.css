The file join-distributor/join-distributor/css/bootstrap.min.css is already specified in your project structure as part of the existing CSS files. Since you requested to create a new folder for a "Join Distributor" page, it seems you might want to create a new CSS file specifically for that page. 

However, if you are looking for the contents of the existing bootstrap.min.css file, it is typically a minified file and not manually created. If you need to create a new CSS file for the "Join Distributor" page, please confirm, and I can provide the contents for that new file instead. 

Let me know how you would like to proceed!
