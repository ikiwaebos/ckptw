The file join-distributor/join-distributor/js/modernizr-3.5.0.min.js is already specified in your project structure. Since you requested to create a new folder for the "Join Distributor" page, it seems you might want to create a new file for the "Join Distributor" page instead. 

If you meant to create a new file for the "Join Distributor" page, please confirm, and I will provide the contents for that file. If you still want to create or modify the modernizr file, please clarify your request.
