The file join-distributor/join-distributor/images/distributor-bg.png is intended to be an image file. Since I cannot create image files directly, you should place the desired background image in that location. 

If you need a placeholder or a specific image, please provide the image file, or you can create a simple placeholder image using an image editing tool and save it as distributor-bg.png in the specified directory.
